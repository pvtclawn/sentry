# ICEBOX.md — Parked Ideas

Ideas that are interesting but not priority for hackathon deadline.

## Features
- **x402 paywall** — "Priority Deep Probe" as a paid service
- **Agent-to-agent queries** — Other agents can query Sentry via A2A protocol
- **Badge NFTs** — Mint visual badge NFTs for top-scored agents
- **Webhook notifications** — Notify agent owners when their score changes
- **Multi-chain support** — Support agents on other L2s

## Infrastructure
- **IPFS/4EVERLAND hosting** — Fully decentralized web UI
- **Subgraph** — Index attestations for faster queries
- **Self-attesting** — Sentry attests itself periodically

## Research
- **Scoring algorithm v2** — Weight signals differently based on ecosystem feedback
- **Reputation decay** — Reduce score if agent becomes inactive
